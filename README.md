## Project Overview

This project implements a numerical ID3-style decision tree baseline for classifying hematological diagnosis categories using complete blood count (CBC) measurements.

The baseline uses entropy and information gain to select numerical splitting thresholds.

## Features

The dataset contains the following CBC features:

- WBC
- LYMp
- NEUTp
- LYMn
- NEUTn
- RBC
- HGB
- HCT
- MCV
- MCH
- MCHC
- PLT
- PDW
- PCT

The target column is `Diagnosis`.

## Requirements

- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

Install the dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

The Streamlit app can read CBC values from report images using Tesseract OCR.
Install the Tesseract application on the computer running the app, in addition
to the Python requirements. Text based PDFs are read with `pypdf`; scanned PDFs
should be uploaded as clear images. Always review and correct extracted values
before running a prediction.

## Running the Baseline

1. Obtain the dataset from its source and verify its license.
2. Place the permitted CSV file in the project directory.
3. Run:

```bash
python id3_numeric_baseline.py
```

4. Enter the CSV filename when prompted.
5. Enter `Diagnosis` as the target column.

## Preliminary Results

A preliminary evaluation on a screened dataset containing 1,212 records used 909 training records and 303 testing records, producing 99.01% accuracy.

These results have not yet been fully validated. Dataset provenance, data quality, potential label leakage, and evaluation methodology require further investigation.

## Disclaimer

This is an academic research prototype, not a clinically validated diagnostic system. Predictions must not be used for medical diagnosis or treatment decisions.
